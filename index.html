    <li><strong>Do Epic Shit, </strong> Author: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankur_Warikoo">Ankur Warikoo</a><strong></strong> <em>In his first book, Do Epic Shit”, Ankur Warikoo talks about success and failures, importance of habits,
        self-awareness, entrepreneurship, money and relationships.
        At times stressing more on the failures and what he has learnt from them.
        We need more such mentors to come forward who are open to share and celebrate their failures more than success.</em></li>

    <li><strong>Atomic Habits, </strong>Author: <a href="https://jamesclear.com/">James Clear</a><strong></strong> <em>An atomic habit is a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do but is also the source of incredible power;
        a component of the system of compound growth. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.
